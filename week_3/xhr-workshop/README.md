# XHR workshop (60 minutes)

In this workshop we will build a small web app that allows users to search for GIFs by a word or phrase and gets a list of GIFs. We will use:
- an HTTP GET request
- DOM manipulation.

When the user has typed in a word or phrase they should be able to trigger the API call to Giphy by pressing the *Search* button.

## Giphy API

We're going to explore the [Giphy API](http://api.giphy.com/) (Giphy is an animated GIF search engine) and learn how to read API documentation.

Most good APIs have detailed docs which you should read to find out exactly what information is available to you. Docs should also help you find out how to build your queries and will often provide sample requests and response objects.

## Tools

The first thing we want to do is install a couple of tools to make our lives a lot easier.

[JSONView](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jsonview/chklaanhfefbnpoihckbnefhakgolnmc) is a Chrome extension that will automatically make JSON data much more readable in Chrome.

[Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) is a Chrome app that we can use to easily make API requests. Check out the docs and install the app from [here](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/).

[prettyjson](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prettyjson) is a package for formatting JSON data. To install it run in your terminal `npm install -g prettyjson`

## Getting started

1. Clone this repo and open it in your text editor.

2. Open the API Documentation and follow the **Steps**.

You can find the API Documentation [here](https://developers.giphy.com/docs/).

## Steps

### 1. Have a look at documentation

- Find the endpoint we need

   > The endpoint is the URL that can be reached by client-side applications

- Check if you need an API key (if yes where to add it)

- Build your URL

- Check your response (via the URL) - see what your JSON looks like

  You can do this in a couple of ways:

 - You can access an API in your web browser by popping the url into the address bar

 - You can access the API using `curl` by running in your terminal `curl "your-url-here" | prettyjson`

 - You can use [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/)

### 2. Open index.js  

- We will need to pass the phrase to Giphy, so we need to extract it from the input text box.

- Make a request to Giphy with the user input as your search paramater.

If you don't remember how [here](https://github.com/lucymonie/api-workshop/blob/master/03-xmlhttprequest.md)
is a reminder.

### 3. Bonus

 - Style your website (follow BEM conventions)

 - Is there a way to return more/less GIFs? If so, try to implement it!
