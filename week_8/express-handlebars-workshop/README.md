# Express Handlebars.js Workshop

This is a workshop designed to help you learn html templating using Handlebars.js.
The main objectives of the workshop are to:
- learn how to serve dynamic files using Handlebars.js templates
- learn how to use Handlebars views, layouts and partials
- be introduced to Handlebars helpers

## What is a template engine and what is Handlebars.js?
- A template engine is software that is designed to combine reusable text (i.e. templates) with data in order to generate HTML.
- Handlebars.js is one of the most popular JavaScript templating engines that builds on top of the [Mustache](https://github.com/janl/mustache.js) templating engine and has therefore compatible syntax with Mustache.
- Handlebars is designed so that it minimises writing lots of JavaScript logic inside the templates. Unlike other template engines such as Jade, it requires full HTML code and can have embedded placeholders that can "hold" data. For example:
```hbs
<h1>{{title}}</h1>
<p>{{description}}</p>
```
- Handlebars can be used for both client-side and server-side *rendering*.

**What is rendering?**
In the context of software, rendering generally means [generating an image from code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_rendering). In the context of express / handlebars it is slightly different. When we use the [```render```](http://expressjs.com/en/api.html#res.render) function in express, we are telling  express to use the rendering engine (in our case handlebars) to take various pieces of input and compose them into an html string to be sent to the client. If the client is a web browser, it will take care of turning the string into an image on the users screen.

## Using Handlebars with Express
Express has extensive support for template rendering and can load and leverage Handlebars.js with the full use of:
- **layouts** (i.e. base templates)
- **partials** (smaller templates within templates) and
- **helpers** (functions used in templates to manipulate data) to ultimately render **views**.

## Dive into coding

**The Task**

The task folder in this repo holds an existing site, including multiple html files. Many of these html files include duplicated code. We are going to use the power of handlebars templates, partials and helpers to remove this duplication, dramatically reducing the number of files and amount of code.

### Set Up

1. Clone this repo
1. `cd task/`
1. Run `npm install` to install all the Node dependencies
1. Review the existing folder structure

  Notice that in order to serve individual fruit pages we have many static `.html` pages.

  <img src="./images-readme/folder-structure-fruits-html.png" width="200px" height="auto"/>

  Notice also that we have two html files to handle errors.

  Handlebars will help us to avoid duplication by creating template views. In fact Handlebars will allow us to delete all those html files.

### Install handlebars

 1. In the tasks directory run the follwing code:

    ```bash
    npm i express-handlebars
    ```

### Add handlebars to your project

1. Require express-handlebars in app.js:

    ```js
    const exphbs = require('express-handlebars')
    ```

2. We now need to tell express the location of the ```views``` folder and the views engine that we want to use:
    ```js
    app.set('views', path.join(__dirname, 'views'));
    app.set('view engine', 'hbs');
    ```

3. We use ```app.engine``` to tell express to use the view engine (express-handlebars) to render hbs files. We are also configuring express-handlebars by giving the various directories that the engine will search for, and the default layout.
    ```js
    app.engine(
      'hbs',
      exphbs({
        extname: 'hbs',
        layoutsDir: path.join(__dirname, 'views', 'layouts'),
        partialsDir: path.join(__dirname, 'views', 'partials'),
        defaultLayout: 'main',
      })
    )
    ```
  4. We now need to make the relevant folders. Create a ```views``` directory within src. This is what you set in the app.js file as the directory to hold the hbs files.
  5. In src/views create a ```layouts``` directory.
  6. In src/views create a ```partials``` directory.


### Serving the home page

1. Create a ```home.hbs``` in the views directory
1. Navigate to public/index.html. Copy all the contents to ```home.hbs```.
1. Delete public/index.html.
1. In src/views/layouts create a main.hbs file and insert the following code:
    ```hbs
    {{{ body }}} 
    ```
    Body will be the hbs file we are rendering.

6. To start the server in development mode use the npm script from the ```package.json``` by typing this in your terminal:
    ```bash
    npm run start:watch
    ```

    Load up the server and go to localhost:3000 in your browser; expect to see a 404 error. We are now going to serve up the ```home.hbs``` file.

7. Create a ```home.js``` in src/controllers

8. In ```home.js``` add the following code:
    ```js
    exports.get = (req, res) => {
      res.render('home');
    };
    ```
    Here ```res.render``` renders a view and sends a rendered HTML string to the client.

9. In src/controllers/index.js require in ```home.js```.

10. Add the following line after files are required in:
    ``` js
    router.get('/', home.get);
    ```

### Split up the contents into partials
We are now going to create partials to simplify our website. Partials allow us to reuse snippets of HTML preventing duplication.
1. In src/views/partials create files for the partials that you would like and cut the appropriate content into the partial. Consider putting anything into the partials that is repeated across multiple pages and might be used in multiple layouts.

    For example, you might create partial/htmlHead, and insert the html header into it. 
    
    *What else can you see that could be used across multiple layouts?*

3. The next stage is to continue creating the layout in ```main.hbs```. The goal is to have a layout that you can use for all pages on this site except error pages. **Tips**:
    * Use the [docs](http://handlebarsjs.com/) to find the syntax for inserting partials.
    * As well as partials you can also place things such as ```<html>```, ```<body>```, ```<main>```, and ```<script>``` tags in here.
    * Make sure you keep the ```{{body}}```.
    * After finishing the main layout, ```home.hbs``` should just include content specific to the page (e.g. the content inside ```<section>``` tags).

### Creating The Fruits Page
1. In src/views create a ```fruits.hbs``` file
1. Open public/fruits.html and copy its contents to the ```fruits.hbs``` file
1. Delete ```fruits.html```
1. Remove everything in ```fruits.hbs``` that you have created partials for and inserted in the main layout. The content remaining in fruit.hbs is what will be rendered as ```{{{ body }}}``` in the main.hbs layout.

**See all the many list items? We will create these programmatically using handlebars.**

5. Delete all but one of the list items.

**Open up src/model/index.js and take a look. We will use this list for creating our fruits page.**

6. Now go back to src/controllers/fruits.js and require in the model of fruits.
    ```js
    const fruits = require('./../model/index');
    ```

    ```res.render``` also takes an object as an optional second argument.  Within the view (e.g the hbs file being rendered) values passed in on the options object will be available as variables named after the object keys. This allows us to insert values or use values along with handlebars helpers (see below!) to otherwise customise the view.

7.Change the render function in ```fruits.js``` to the following:

    ```js
    exports.get = (req, res) => {
      res.render('fruits', { fruits });
    };
    ```
  We have passed the fruits model array to the ```render``` function, thereby making it available in ```fruits.hbs```.

#### Using Helpers

**We can now use handlebars' built in helpers to dynamically generate HTML. We are going to use the ```each``` helper to iterate over the fruits array  (similarly to javascript's forEach array method).**

1. We want to iterate over the fruits array for each one creating a list item. 

    ```hbs

        {{#each fruits}}

        <li class="fruit__item">
          <a class="fruit__link" href="/fruits/{{this}}"><div class="fruit__image" style="background-image: url(/images/fruits/{{this}}.jpg)"></div></a>
          <div class="fruit__info">
            <h2 class="fruit__name">{{this}}</h2>
            <svg class="fruit__fav-btn"><use id="js-fav-btn" xlink:href="#icon-heart"></use></svg>
          </div>
        </li>

        {{/each}}

    ```
    * We are iterating over the fruits array creating a new ```<li>``` and all its content for each item.
    * The fruit array contains fruit names and the current value is inserted using the handlebars ```this``` keyword.



### Rendering Individual Fruits Pages

**In public/fruits we have multiple html files and we would like to create these all using a single hbs file. Apply the same steps as above to achieve this.**

Hints:

1. Copy across the relevant HTML code to an hbs file.
2. Change the controllers/singlefruit.js.
3. In the previous example we passed an array as an object property. You can make as many key value pairs on the object as you want, and they don't have to be arrays.

### Custom Helpers
You have come across the ```each``` helper that is built in to handlebars, but we can also create our own helpers in plain javascript.

1. Within views create a helpers directory
1. Within views/helpers create the following files:
    * ```uppercase.js``` - this will contain a helper for making a string uppercase.
    * ```index.js``` - this will be an index for all the helpers (more to come later!), and will export them on an object.

3. We want to to make all the letters in the fruit name in ```fruits.hbs``` uppercase. In ```uppercase.js``` add the following code:
    ```js
    module.exports = str => str.toUpperCase();
    ```
4. In ```index.js``` add the following code:
    ```js
    module.exports = {
      uppercase: require('./uppercase'),
    };
    ```
5. In src/app.js require in the helper from views/helpers/index.js:
    ```js
    const helpers = require('./views/helpers/index');
    ```
6. In the ```app.js``` update ```app.engine``` to pass the helpers object to express-handlebars.
    ```js
    app.engine(
      'hbs',
      exphbs({
        extname: 'hbs',
        layoutsDir: path.join(__dirname, 'views', 'layouts'),
        partialsDir: path.join(__dirname, 'views', 'partials'),
        defaultLayout: 'main',
        helpers,
      })
    );
    ```
7. We now need to use this in our ```singlefruit.hbs``` file. Update the ```<h1>``` element in the singlefruit.hbs as follows:
    ```hbs
      <h1 class="main__title">{{uppercase singleFruit}}</h1>
    ```

8. **Challenge:** Create a helper that capitalises the first letter of the fruit name title for each of the multiple fruits in ```fruits.hbs```. On the /fruits page the title associated with each of the multiple fruit images should be capitalised.


## (Stretch) Passing Objects to Change CSS 

**Challenge: Underline the current page link. When on the home page, home should be underlined, and when on the fruits page, fruits should be underlined.**

Hints
* Pass an object from within the relevant controller to help you change the css appropriately.
* Use the appropriate handlebars helper, [see docs](http://handlebarsjs.com/).
* A css class ```.navbar__link--active``` has already been defined for you.

## (Extra) Error Refactor
**We specified the default layout as main.hbs. We can override this directly when we render a page. We will use a specific error layout when rendering an error page.**

1. Create an error.hbs file in the views folder.
    ```html
    <section class="error">
      <p class="error__desc">{{statusCode}}. <span class="error__msg">{{errorMessage}}</span></p>
      <img class="error__image" src="/images/error.png" alt="error">
    </section>
    ```
1. Add an ```error.hbs``` file into views/layouts. It should look something like:
    ```hbs
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
      {{>htmlHead}}
    <body>

      <main class="main">
      {{{body}}}
      </main>

    </body>
    </html>
    ```

3. In ```error.js``` update the code as follows:
    ```js
    const path = require('path');

    exports.client = (req, res) => {
      res.status(404).render('error', {
        layout: 'error',
        statusCode: 404,
        errorMessage: 'Page not found',
      });
    };

    exports.server = (err, req, res, next) => {
      res.status(500).render('error', {
        layout: 'error',
        statusCode: 500,
        errorMessage: 'Internal server error',
      });
    };
    ```
    Note that we specified the layout to be used by express handlebars.
